Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science could be applied to the transportation field.
An example is that when you get on the metro and you swipe your card 
it could track the time from when you entered the metro system to when you
exit the metro system to calculate the average travel time of users.
This information could be used for various reasons such as marketing
and how to imnprove travel for consumers. 


Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging is when you combine two branches from your repository
I've usen this when I have a seperate branch where I am trying 
to integrate new features without trying to affect an old branch. Then I can merge them
you are ready to integrate the new code. Into the existing files
Rebasing is when you have a new set of branches you want to use 
instead of the original branches you have. I have not used this but I would use it 
if I wanted to have a more organized history when trying to look through old committs. 


Q4: What are you looking forward to this semester?

Answer: I feel like this class is very funcational and has a lot of 
applications to real world problems. I am looking forward to taking
what I learn from this class and being able to apply it to my
own projects in the future!
